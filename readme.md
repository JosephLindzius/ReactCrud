# React Hooks CRUD


This was my first attempt at learning how to make CRUD using React.
The backend can be run through running 'node server.js' and the front end is run through 'yarn run'.

  
### Next Steps

Sadly, the data structure is not yet really working but basic display is functional albeit limited by what I have added to server.js file itself.  The goal is to add a database but this is not yet possible with my react skills.
